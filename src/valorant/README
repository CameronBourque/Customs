#Valorant
This is where the Valo API comes in handy

#TODO
- Sign up for the valorant API
- Research what is possible using that API

#Plans
- If possible, keep track of match stats in real time
- Record match history and player stats specifically for the custom games
- Keep database records of each player linked to their discord names
